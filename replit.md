# AI Agent Dashboard

## Overview

This is a comprehensive next-generation AI agent system with advanced learning, automation, and creative capabilities. The system features a modular architecture with an AI orchestrator that coordinates multiple specialized components including computer vision, UI automation, learning systems, and various task-specific modules. The agent provides a web-based dashboard for control and monitoring, supports multiple LLM backends with intelligent switching, and includes advanced features like social media automation, content generation, file processing, and security management.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**AI Orchestrator**: Central coordination system that manages all AI agent components. Acts as the main entry point and orchestrates communication between different modules. Handles task scheduling, component lifecycle management, and system-wide coordination.

**LLM Manager**: Handles multiple AI model backends (Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio) with intelligent switching capabilities. Provides fallback mechanisms and manages conversation history across different models.

**Computer Vision System**: Advanced visual processing for UI element detection, OCR capabilities, template matching, and screen monitoring. Caches UI elements and templates for improved performance.

**UI Automation**: Comprehensive user interface interaction system using PyAutoGUI for cross-platform automation. Manages window caching, interaction history, and intelligent element detection.

**Learning System**: Machine learning-based user behavior analysis and pattern recognition using scikit-learn. Includes anomaly detection, behavior clustering, and predictive modeling capabilities.

**Memory Manager**: Advanced context and conversation management with SQLite backend. Implements short-term memory queues, context caching, and memory embeddings for intelligent retrieval.

### Specialized Modules

**Social Media Handler**: Multi-platform automation for Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Discord. Includes scheduled posting, mention monitoring, and analytics tracking.

**Browser Controller**: Web automation using Selenium WebDriver with support for Chrome automation, page caching, and custom automation scripts.

**Content Generator**: Creative content generation system supporting text, image, video, audio, and document formats. Includes templates, style presets, and integration with external generation services.

**File Processor**: Document processing system supporting PDF, Word, Excel, images, and archives. Includes OCR capabilities and content extraction rules.

**Task Scheduler**: Advanced scheduling system with support for time-based, interval, cron, event, and condition-based triggers. Implements priority queuing and task lifecycle management.

**Notification Manager**: Smart notification handling with priority levels, filtering, categorization, and expiration management.

**Security Manager**: Comprehensive security controls with encryption, threat detection, access logging, and security policy enforcement.

### Utility Components

**NLP Processor**: Natural language processing using spaCy and NLTK for sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and intent classification.

**Voice Handler**: Speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities for voice interaction.

**Translation Service**: Multi-language support with Google Translate integration and caching mechanisms.

**System Monitor**: Performance tracking and system monitoring with configurable thresholds and alerting.

### Web Interface

**Frontend**: Bootstrap-based responsive dashboard with real-time updates via WebSocket connections. Supports tabbed navigation for different system aspects (overview, commands, tasks, learning, system monitoring).

**Backend**: Flask application with SocketIO for real-time communication. Provides REST API endpoints for system status and control.

### Design Patterns

The system follows a modular, event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns. Components communicate through the central orchestrator using async/await patterns. The system implements caching strategies throughout for performance optimization and includes comprehensive error handling and logging.
